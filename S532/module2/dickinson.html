<p>
I heard a fly buzz when I died;<br>
The stillness round my form<br>
Was like the stillness in the air<br>
Between the heaves of storm.
</p>
<p>
The eyes beside had wrung them dry,<br>
And breaths were gathering sure<br>
For that last onset, when the King<br>
Be witnessed in his power.
</p>
<p>
I willed my keepsakes, signed away<br>
What portion of me I<br>
Could make assignable &#8212; and then<br>
There interposed a fly,
</p>
<p>
With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz<br>
Between the light and me;<br>
And then the windows failed &#8212; and then<br>
I could not see to see.
